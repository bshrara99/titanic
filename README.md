# Titanic - Analysis & Results

## Overview

This repository/notebook (`titanic.ipynb`) contains a complete end-to-end analysis of the Titanic dataset (survival prediction). The notebook walks through data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation and interpretation. This README explains the results you will find in the notebook and how to reproduce them.

* Common libraries used (install via `pip` or `conda`):

  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook /mnt/data/titanic.ipynb
   ```
2. Restart kernel and run all cells (to ensure deterministic output, run cells from top to bottom).
3. All generated figures, confusion matrices, and metric values are shown inline in the notebook.

## Notebook structure (step-by-step)

1. **Data loading** — reads the CSV(s) (usually `train.csv` and/or `test.csv`) and prints initial rows and basic info (shape, missing values).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — distributions and relationships of variables (age, sex, Pclass, fare, embarked, family size, etc.) and survival rate summaries.
3. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** — handling missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked), encoding categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`), creating features (Title extracted from name, FamilySize, IsAlone, Age bins, Fare bins), scaling if required.
4. **Modeling** — training one or several models (typical choices in this notebook): Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and possibly a baseline (dummy classifier).
5. **Evaluation** — calculating metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC) and plotting confusion matrix and ROC curve. Cross-validation results may be shown.
6. **Interpretation** — feature importance (for tree-based models), coefficients (for linear models), partial interpretations and business-relevant insights.
7. **Conclusions & Recommendations** — short summary of findings and suggested next steps.

## Explanation of the Results (what to look for and how to interpret)

Below are the typical outputs and explanations so you can understand what each result means and how to use it.

### 1. Data summary & EDA

* **Survival Rate**: The notebook reports overall survival rate (e.g., fraction of passengers who survived). This gives a baseline expectation and helps interpret class imbalance.
* **Group summaries**: Survival broken down by `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age` groups, and `Embarked` — pay attention to these as they identify the strongest signals (for example, historically, females survived at a much higher rate than males; higher-class passengers tended to survive more).

**How to use:** If the EDA shows very strong differences (e.g., `Sex` is highly predictive), those features will likely be selected as important by models.

### 2. Missing values handling

* **Age**: Commonly imputed (median, mean, or with a predictive strategy). The README notes which strategy the notebook used — check the exact cell.
* **Cabin**: Often dropped or converted to `has_cabin` boolean because of many missing values.

**How to use:** Imputation strategy affects model performance and interpretability. If Age imputation is naive, consider a model-based imputation later.

### 3. Feature engineering

* **Title extraction** (Mr/Mrs/Miss/Master/Other) can capture social status and has predictive power.
* **Family size / IsAlone** — indicates whether the passenger was traveling alone; sometimes correlated with survival.

**How to use:** Inspect the `feature importance` section to see which engineered features helped most.

### 4. Model performance metrics

The notebook typically reports the following for each model trained:

* **Accuracy** — overall fraction of correct predictions.
* **Precision** — proportion of positive predictions that were correct.
* **Recall (Sensitivity)** — proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
* **F1 score** — harmonic mean of precision and recall; useful for imbalanced classes.
* **ROC AUC** — area under the ROC curve; measures ranking performance of the model across thresholds.

**How to interpret them together:**

* If accuracy is high but recall is low, the model may be missing survivors (false negatives) while still predicting many non-survivors correctly.
* Prefer F1 or recall if detecting survivors is the priority. ROC AUC is threshold-independent and useful to compare models.

> **Where to find numbers:** Look for cells titled "Model evaluation", "Metrics", or individual model result prints in the notebook. Replace any placeholders in summary with the numeric values shown there.

### 5. Confusion matrix

* The confusion matrix shows true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN).

**Interpretation:**

* High FN (missed survivors) may be undesirable depending on the application. Decide whether minimizing FN or FP is more important and choose thresholds accordingly.

### 6. Feature importance & coefficients

* **Tree-based models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) list feature importances. Features with higher importance had larger influence in the model decisions.
* **Linear models** (Logistic Regression) show coefficients (sign + magnitude): positive values increase the log-odds of survival, negative values decrease it.

**Typical findings:** `Sex` (female), `Pclass` (1st class), `Title` (Mrs/Miss), and lower `Age` often have positive associations with survival.

### 7. Cross-validation & stability

* If cross-validation is used, you will see mean and standard deviation of metrics. Low variance across folds indicates stable model performance.

---

## Suggested conclusions (example phrasing)

> From the trained models and EDA, the strongest predictors of survival in this dataset are `Sex`, `Pclass`, and derived features such as `Title` and `FamilySize`. Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) often give the best trade-off between predictive performance and interpretability via feature importance.

> If you need a single model for production, choose the model with the best validation ROC AUC and consistent cross-validation performance, then tune thresholds to balance precision/recall according to the application need.

## Limitations

1. **Data size and representativeness** — Titanic is a small historical dataset; generalization outside the dataset is limited.
2. **Missing information** — cabin information and incomplete ages limit inference.
3. **Imputation bias** — naive imputation can introduce bias; model-based imputation may be preferable.

---

## Next steps / Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV) for each model.
* Try ensemble stacking of best models.
* Use model explainability tools (SHAP) for local explanations.
* Experiment with more advanced imputation for Age and Cabin.
* Calibrate predicted probabilities if you need well-calibrated probability scores.
